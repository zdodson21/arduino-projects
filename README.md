# Arduino Project Code

Just some code for various Arduino projects I've completed that don't belong in their own repos.

## Dependencies

Building and Uploading to Arduino requires [*PlatformIO* CLI Tools](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/shell-commands.html#unix-and-unix-like) OR [*PlatformIO* IDE Tools](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/pioide.html#pioide)

## Build

In directory for specific project:

```bash
platformio run
```

## Upload to Arduino

In directory for specific project:

```bash
platformio run --target upload
```
